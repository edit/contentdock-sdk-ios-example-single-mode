This is an example project using the contentDock SDK for iOS in single mode.

## About contentDock
With the App Construction Kit from contentDock速 you can create iOS apps for your business, organization or educational institution - without programming knowledge. 

By default, contentDock速 offers a large of different content elements with which you can design your apps.
If these elements are not sufficient for the desired functions of your app, you can develop additional functions and integrate them into your apps with our contentDock速 SDK without limits.

Combine the advantages of our construction kit, the workflow and the contentDock速 SDK.
Develop your individual functions for the apps of your customers and transforms the apps into exclusive native apps in a few simple steps.
